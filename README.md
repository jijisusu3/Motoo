### Motoo, a mock stock investment education platform for youth



### üìäProject Introduction

- Motoo is a mock stock trading platform designed to help students learn financial investment concepts through interactive and gamified experiences. Nearly half of Korean students have experience with financial investment, yet high school economics textbooks barely cover the topic. Also, existing mock investment competitions are one-off events, and real stock platforms remain inaccessible to young users.
- To bridge this gap, Motoo provides a structured and engaging learning environment, allowing students to grasp investment concepts in simpler terms and practice mock trading in a realistic but risk-free setting. The platform features real-time stock search, price visualization, and portfolio management tools, making financial learning more accessible and practical for students.

### :classical_building: Introduction to Technology

#### Stock Data

- Developed a system to fetch and store stock data using the **Korea Investment & Securities Open API** and **pykrx**.

- Details:

  - Frequently accessed but short-lived data (e.g., order book, API access tokens) is stored and retrieved using Redis for efficiency.

  - Since retrieving data for over 900 stocks at once via Open API was challenging.

    - Optimized the process to fetch 20 stocks per second.
    - Implemented asynchronous data retrieval to maximize performance while adhering to API rate limits.
    - Used bulk create, update, and insert operations in the database to handle large data volumes while reducing server load.
  
  - Automated real-time stock data updates using Typer library and crontab

    

#### Industry & Stock-Specific Keyword Analysis

- News Collection: Used the Naver Search API to gather financial news.

- Keyword Analysis:

  - Instead of using a dedicated NLP module, processed data directly.

  - Avoided excessive morphological decomposition (e.g., ‚ÄúArtificial Intelligence‚Äù being split into ‚ÄúArtificial‚Äù and ‚ÄúIntelligence‚Äù) by manually refining data.

  - Preprocessed data by removing special characters, particles, and stopwords, then structured them into a dataset.

  - Counted word frequencies and provided users with the **top 10 most frequent keywords**, helping them quickly understand trends in specific industries and companies.


  

#### Industry & Stock-Specific Sentiment Analysis

- Used the KR-FinBERT model, trained on Korean financial articles, for sentiment analysis.

- Implementation Process:
  - Cleaned the dataset by removing unnecessary special characters.
  - Tokenized text using Transformers and pre-trained models.
  - Used TQDM to monitor progress while processing the dataset.
  - Converted output values into **tensors** using **PyTorch** for deep learning-based computations.
  - Computed sentiment scores in the order of negative-neutral-positive, as defined by the KR-FinBERT model.
  - Displayed sentiment results using **weather icons (cloudy-neutral-sunny)**, allowing users to quickly assess the market sentiment of a specific industry or company.
